# Mobile Automation Framework (Java · Appium · TestNG · Cucumber)
A portfolio-style mobile automation framework demonstrating production-grade structure, reporting, and stability patterns using a **realistic login flow** with multiple outcomes.

## Feature Under Test
**Login** is intentionally chosen because it is simple in scope but rich in behavior. This project validates **four scenarios**:
* Valid credentials → user reaches the secret area and identity is verified.
* Invalid credentials → error/alert is shown.
* Wrong password → error/alert is shown.
* Empty username → error/alert is shown.

The result is a compact suite that still exercises synchronization, page flows, and robust assertions.

## Highlights
* **Page Object Model + flow orchestration** for clean separation of concerns, and maintainable test architecture.
* **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber** for readable, business-readable scenarios.
* **TestNG orchestration** with extensible runners.
* **CI/CD integration** for automated test execution in pipelines for iOS (macOS) and Android (Linux).
* **Allure reporting** for clear test insights.
* **Structured logging** for traceability and debugging.
* **Failure-proofing techniques** to increase test stability and reduce flakiness.
* **Defensive UI handling** for variable login outcomes (alerts, invalid states).
* **Extensible configuration** via JSON device profiles.
* **Modular design** with POM + flows + steps.
* **Parallel execution** *(available on the `development` branch)*.

## Quick Start
For users who want to run the project quickly:
```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd mobile-automation

# 2. Install dependencies
mvn -q -DskipTests install

# 3. Install Appium + driver
npm install -g appium
appium driver install uiautomator2

# 4. Start Appium manually
appium --log-level warn
```
Run tests on iOS:
```bash
# 5. Run iOS tests
mvn test -Dplatform=ios

# Optional: generate Allure report
allure serve allure-results
```
Run tests on Android:
```bash
# 5. Run Android tests
mvn test -Dplatform=android

# Optional: generate Allure report
allure serve allure-results
```

## Java & Appium Setup
This section documents how to set up your machine for Appium-based mobile test automation development.
<details> <summary><strong>Read more..</strong></summary>

### Java and Maven
This project requires Java 17 and Maven.

Verify versions:
```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

### Node.js and Appium
Appium is installed via npm:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
npm install -g appium
```
Install the Android driver:
```bash
appium driver install uiautomator2
```

### iOS Requirements
macOS is required for iOS automation.
You must have:
* Xcode installed
* Command Line Tools installed
* iOS Simulator available

Verify Xcode:
```bash
xcodebuild -version
xcrun simctl list devices
```

### Android Requirements
Android automation requires the Android SDK and an emulator or device.
Verify SDK tools:
```bash
adb version
emulator -version
```
</details>

## Allure Setup
Allure Reporting provides rich, visual test reports generated from your framework.
<details> <summary><strong>Read more..</strong></summary>

### Install Allure
macOS (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install allure
```

Windows: Download the Allure ZIP from the official distribution page, extract it, and add the bin folder to your system path.

Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qameta/allure
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install allure
```

Verify installation:
```bash
allure --version
```

### Viewing Test Reports
After running your tests, an Allure results folder will be created. To generate and view the report:
```bash
allure serve allure-results
```
This command builds the report and opens it in your browser.
</details>

## Running Tests
This project uses Maven, TestNG, and Cucumber to run the automation suite.

### Parallel Execution (Development Branch)
**Parallel test execution is implemented on the `development` branch.** If you want parallel runs, switch to that branch and follow the branch-specific README instructions.

### iOS Execution
Update iOS device config:
```bash
cat src/test/resources/config/ios.json
```
Run:
```bash
mvn test -Dplatform=ios
```

### Android Execution
Update Android device config:
```bash
cat src/test/resources/config/android.json
```
Run:
```bash
mvn test -Dplatform=android
```

### CI Execution
GitHub Actions workflows live under:
```bash
.github/workflows/
```
They run iOS on macOS runners and Android on Ubuntu runners.

## Troubleshooting
A collection of common issues and quick fixes for running the mobile automation project.

### Appium Server Not Found
__Symptom__: `SessionNotCreatedException` or `ECONNREFUSED` to Appium server.

__Fix__:
```bash
appium --log-level warn --port 4723
```

### Android Emulator Offline
__Symptom__: `adb: device offline` or boot never completes.

__Fix__:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices
```

### iOS WDA Slow Startup
__Symptom__: WDA session takes several minutes.

__Fix__:
* Ensure Xcode is installed and set as active
* Pre-boot the simulator before running tests

```bash
xcrun simctl boot "<device-name>" || true
xcrun simctl bootstatus "<device-name>" -b
```

### Allure Report Empty
__Symptom__: Allure opens a report with 0 tests.

__Fix__:
* Ensure tests ran before generating the report
* Verify `allure-results` exists

```bash
ls -la allure-results
```
